;; # Introduction
;;
;; In this lab you get to write a BST like the one we did in class, only
;; this time it is a dictionary structure and not a set.
;; As such, the "data" element from before will have a key and value instead.

(defrecord BST [root size])
(defrecord BNode [left key value right])

(defn make-node
  ([key value]  (make-node nil key value nil))
  ([left key value right] (BNode. left key value right))
  )

(defn make-tree []
  (BST. nil 0))

;; # Size
;;;
;; A warmup function.

(defn size "Return the size of the tree."
  [t]
(:size t))

;; # Add
;;
;; The nodes will be entered into the tree on the basis of their key.
;; If someone tries to add a key that is already there, we replace the value
;; with the new entry.

(declare add-aux)
(defn add "Add a key and value to the BST."
[bst nu-key nu-val]
  (cond (= 0 (:size bst))
(BST. (add-aux (:root bst) nu-key nu-val bst) (+ 1 (-> bst :size)))
  :else
   (BST. (add-aux (:root bst) nu-key nu-val bst)  (-> bst :size)))

)

(defn add-aux [node nu-key nu-val bst]
(cond (nil? node) (make-node nu-key nu-val)
(= nu-key (:key node)) (make-node (:left node) nu-key nu-val (:right node))
(> nu-key (:key node)) (make-node (:left node) (:key node) (:value node) (add-aux (:right node) nu-key nu-val bst))
:else (make-node (add-aux (:left node) nu-key nu-val bst) (:key node) (:value node) (:right node)))

;; # Find
;;
;; We need two versions of find.  The first one takes a key and returns the
;; value.  The second takes a value and returns the key.  Note that the second
;; version of the function must search the entire tree!  If the search item is not
;; there, return nil.

(defn find "Look for a key and return the corresponding value."
  [bst look-key] nil)

(defn find-key "Look for a value and return the corresponding key."
  [bst look-value] nil)

;; # Delete
;;
;; Similiarly, we have two versions of delete.  Please use the predecessor node if
;; you need to delete a child with two elements.

(defn delete [bst victim]
  nil
  )

(defn delete-value [bst victim]
  nil
  )

;; # Map Tree
;;
;; This function takes a tree t and maps a function f over it.
;; If your tree is ((x 3 x) 5 ((x 7 x) 6 x)), then (map-tree t inc)
;; will return ((x 4 x) 6 ((x 8 x) 7 x))

(defn map-tree
  [t f] nil)
